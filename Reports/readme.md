  <summary>BDR Dashboard</summary>
  
### Summary 
The Basic Data Retrieval (BDR) Dashboard is a quick way to extract fundamental information about a given equity, in a standardized report format. While in-depth analysis will need a lot of manual scouring
we can still get a good glance on short notice that will give a good idea if there are any red flags about the given equity to discourage further investigation
